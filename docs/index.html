                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a second-year student at the Faculty of Computer Science in Belarus.
                    At this stage of my education, I am drawn towards the field of software development,
                    with a particular interest in utilizing the C# programming language and the WinUI3 framework.
                    While I have yet to gain practical work experience or participate in an internship,
                    I am dedicated to participating in various projects to accumulate valuable hands-on experience.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Alongside my focus on specific technologies and tools, I am also committed to enhancing my logical
                    thinking and problem-solving abilities. I actively involve myself in solving a variety of tasks,
                    as this approach aids in the development of my analytical and solution-oriented skills.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Although I am currently inclined towards software development,
                    I haven't fully decided on the specific direction I wish to pursue within the field.
                    As I continue my studies and gain more exposure to different aspects of computer science,
                    I am keeping an open mind and exploring various possibilities to determine my true passion and specialization.
                </p>
